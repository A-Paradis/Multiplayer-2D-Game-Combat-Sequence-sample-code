# Multiplayer-2D-Game-Combat-Sequence-sample-code

This repository contains a selection of sample code I personally contributed to as part of a collaborative project for a 2D multiplayer indie game.
Due to collaborative considerations and team ownership, Iâ€™m only sharing portions of the code that I wrote myself. While this was a team project, I primarily focused on the backend development using TypeScript and NestJS

My Contributions
- Implemented player-vs-player combat logic and real-time state sync
- Designed and tested backend endpoints using NestJS
- Integrated MongoDB for map edition persistence
- Collaborated using Git and GitLab in an Agile workflow

The goal of this repo is to highlight my experience working with:
TypeScript and Angular for the frontend
TypeScript and NestJS for the backend
Ream-time multiplayer logic and client-server state sync
Deployment on AWS EC2 with MongoDB for persistance
