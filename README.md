# Multiplayer 2D Combat Game Sample Code

This repository contains a selection of sample code I personally contributed to as part of a collaborative project for a 2D multiplayer indie game.
Due to collaborative considerations and team ownership, I’m only sharing portions of the code that I wrote myself. While this was a team project, I primarily focused on the backend development using TypeScript and NestJS.
However, I did implement a minimal UI for the combat sequence using TypeScript and Angular Material. 

My Contributions
- Implemented player-vs-player combat logic and real-time state sync
- Designed and tested backend endpoints using NestJS
- Integrated MongoDB for map edition persistence
- Collaborated using GitLab in an Agile workflow

The goal of this repo is to highlight my experience working with:
- TypeScript and Angular for the frontend
- TypeScript and NestJS for the backend
- Real-time multiplayer logic and client-server state sync
- Deployment on AWS EC2 with MongoDB for persistance

This project represents a snapshot of my skills at the time. Although I don’t plan to continue developing it, it was a rewarding opportunity to grow in backend development, multiplayer logic, and collaborative software engineering.
